implement fscr

ann.fit etc

=======
shyh wei - threshold

train_x
train_y

test_x
test_y

1. Original: Train(train_x,train_y) - Score(test_x,test_y) ------
2. FE: Z = features(train_x,train_y) -----
3. Train(Z(train_x),train_y) - Score(Z(train_x),train_y)
4. Train(Z(train_x),train_y) - Score(Z(test_x),test_y)

======
Added limitation - FSA for ANN only
==

do these tests, dump these cols
====
Ideas
1: Feature selection model DL?

validate against other datasets?
==========

justific - 1dcnn - requires downsize
--hsi downsize could lose valuable info
---lot of params needed for multiple cnn layers

====

improve perform with MLP


Best shot till now: linear of internal, mlp for metric ev for trads, mlp for metric ev for fscr.
Addition: If required - "FS for ANN" [or favoured for ANN - and concise list]

===
show resulting indices
check if consistent with model

list limitation which can be addresses

==========

1. stop overlapping
2. exploitation vs exploration
3. better than cubic spline
4. select band sequence
5. mutation
6. skip
